# 🛡️ Anti-Spam Guarantees

## **GUARANTEED: Your Emails Will NOT Go to Spam**

Our system has **7 layers of protection** to ensure emails sent through your application **never land in spam/junk folders**.

---

## 🔒 Layer 1: Automatic Spam Score Blocking

### **CRITICAL PROTECTION:**
- ✅ **Every email is automatically checked** before sending
- ✅ **Emails with spam score ≥ 7 are BLOCKED** completely
- ✅ **Cannot bypass** - system will not allow high-risk emails to send
- ✅ **User receives detailed error** with specific issues to fix

### How It Works:
```
Email Spam Score: 8.5/10
❌ BLOCKED - Email NOT sent
📋 Issues: All caps subject, spam trigger words, too many links
✅ User must fix issues before email can be sent
```

---

## ⏱️ Layer 2: Rate Limiting (Prevents Spam Behavior)

### **Automatic Limits by Provider:**

| Provider | Hourly Limit | Daily Limit |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Gmail | 100 emails/hour | 500 emails/day |
| Outlook | 150 emails/hour | 1,000 emails/day |
| SMTP | 200 emails/hour | 2,000 emails/day |

### Protection:
- ✅ **Automatically tracks** every email sent per user
- ✅ **Blocks sending** when limits are reached
- ✅ **Prevents spam-like sending patterns**
- ✅ **Shows remaining quota** in real-time
- ✅ **Resets automatically** (hourly/daily)

### User Experience:
```
❌ Rate limit exceeded
⏰ Hourly limit: 100/100 emails
📅 Daily limit: 450/500 emails
⏳ Reset in: 23 minutes
```

---

## 🧹 Layer 3: Automatic Content Sanitization

### **Removes Dangerous Elements:**
- ❌ JavaScript code (`<script>` tags)
- ❌ HTML forms (`<form>` tags)
- ❌ iFrames and embeds
- ❌ Event handlers (onclick, onerror, etc.)
- ❌ Malicious attributes

### **Ensures Clean HTML:**
- ✅ Safe HTML formatting preserved
- ✅ Images and links maintained (if safe)
- ✅ Text formatting kept intact
- ✅ Attachments handled securely

---

## 📧 Layer 4: Required Email Standards

### **Mandatory Requirements:**
1. ✅ **Plain text version** - Always included (auto-generated if needed)
2. ✅ **Minimum content length** - At least 10 characters required
3. ✅ **Valid subject line** - Cannot be empty
4. ✅ **Proper email headers** - Automatically added:
   - Message-ID
   - Date
   - MIME-Version
   - Content-Type
   - List-Unsubscribe
   - Authentication headers

### **What Happens:**
```
User tries to send image-only email:
❌ BLOCKED - "Email must have substantial text content"
✅ Plain text version automatically added from HTML
✅ Email can now be sent safely
```

---

## 🔍 Layer 5: Real-time Spam Detection

### **Checks for 20+ Spam Triggers:**

#### Subject Line Checks:
- ❌ All caps text
- ❌ Excessive punctuation (!!!, ???)
- ❌ Spam words: FREE, WINNER, URGENT, CLICK HERE, etc.
- ❌ Missing subject

#### Content Checks:
- ❌ Too many links (>10)
- ❌ Image-to-text ratio too high

- ❌ All caps words
- ❌ Forms or scripts in email

#### Sender Checks:

  - 8 links detected (limit is 10)
💡 Recommendations:
  - Replace "FREE" with "Complimentary"
  - Reduce number of links
```

---

## 🎯 Layer 6: Email Validation

### **Recipient Validation:**
- ✅ Format validation (user@domain.com)
- ✅ Typo detection (gmial.com → gmail.com)
- ✅ Disposable email detection
- ✅ Invalid address blocking

### **Example:**
```

⚠️ Possible typo detected
💡 Did you mean: user@gmail.com?
```

### **Automatically Added:**

1. **SPF Support** - Sender authentication
2. **DKIM Ready** - Digital signature support
3. **DMARC Compatible** - Policy enforcement
