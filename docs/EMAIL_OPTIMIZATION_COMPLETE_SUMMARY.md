## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### 1. Component Splitting ✅
**Problem:** 2,340-line monolithic component  
**Solution:** Split into 7 focused components

**Benefits:**
- Each component has a single responsibility
- Easier to test and maintain
- Better code reusability
- Improved developer experience

### 2. Custom Hooks Extraction ✅
**Problem:** 20+ useState calls, complex state management  
**Solution:** 4 custom hooks encapsulate related state

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner component code
- State logic is reusable
- Easier to test state management
- Better separation of concerns

### 3. Shared Type Definitions ✅
**Problem:** Duplicate type definitions across files  
**Solution:** Single `client/src/types/email.ts` file

**Benefits:**
- 100% type consistency
- Single source of truth
- Easier maintenance
- No type mismatches

### 4. Lazy Loading & Code Splitting ✅
**Problem:** Everything loaded upfront, large initial bundle  
**Solution:** Lazy-loaded 3 modal components

**Lazy-loaded components:**
- `ComposeDialog` - Not needed until user clicks Compose
- `AccountsDialog` - Not needed until user opens settings
- `KeyboardShortcutsDialog` - Not needed until user presses ?

**Benefits:**
- Faster initial page load
- Smaller initial JavaScript bundle
- Components loaded on-demand
- Better performance metrics

### 5. Removed Over-Memoization ✅
**Problem:** Excessive `useCallback`/`useMemo` hurting performance  
**Solution:** Removed unnecessary memoization

**What was removed:**
- `useCallback` for simple setters
- `useMemo` for cheap calculations
- Memoization of trivial functions

**What was kept:**
- `useCallback` for props passed to React.memo components
- `useMemo` for expensive operations (filtering, mapping large arrays)
- Proper memoization only where it helps

**Benefits:**
- Less overhead
- Simpler code
- Faster re-renders
- Better performance

### 6. Optimized React Query ✅
**Problem:** Fetching 50 items per page, excessive data  
**Solution:** Reduced to 30 items per page

**Changes:**
- Reduced page size: 50 → 30 items
- Optimized staleTime/gcTime values
- Better cache invalidation strategy
- Proper optimistic updates

**Benefits:**
- Faster initial load
- Less data transferred
- Better perceived performance
- Smoother scrolling

### 7. Simplified Dependency Chains ✅
**Problem:** Complex hook dependency chains  
**Solution:** Custom hooks with clean interfaces

**Before:**
```javascript
// Complex dependency hell
const handleKeyboardShortcut = useCallback((key) => {
  // Depends on: handleReply, archiveMutation, handleSend
}, [handleReply, archiveMutation, handleSend]);

const handleSend = useCallback(() => {
  // Depends on: composeTo, composeSubject, composeBody, attachments, emailAccounts, sendEmailMutation
}, [composeTo, composeSubject, composeBody, attachments, emailAccounts, sendEmailMutation]);
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Simple, clean
const compose = useEmailCompose(); // Handles all compose state
const handleSend = () => {
  sendEmailMutation.mutate({
    to: compose.state.to,
    subject: compose.state.subject,
    // ...
  });
};
```

**Benefits:**
- No dependency tracking issues
- No stale closures
- Easier to understand
- Less prone to bugs
