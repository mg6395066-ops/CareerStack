## 🚀 **HOW TO TEST** (Step-by-Step)

### **Option 1: Quick Test (5 minutes)**

The absolute minimum to verify critical functionality:

```bash
# 1. Start the development server
npm run dev

# Server will start on http://localhost:5000
```

Then in your browser:

1. **Login** to the application
2. **Upload a DOCX** file or open an existing resume
3. **Make an edit** - Add text like "TEST EDIT - [timestamp]"
4. **Click Save** button
5. **Verify** toast shows: "Document saved to server"
6. **Close** the editor
7. **Reopen** the same document
8. **CHECK**: Is your edit still there? ✅

**If YES**: Critical fix works! Save now persists edits! 🎉  
**If NO**: Check browser console for errors

---

### **Option 2: Comprehensive Test (30-60 minutes)**

Follow the complete testing guide:

```bash
# Open the comprehensive testing guide
cat TESTING_GUIDE_DOCX_IMPROVEMENTS.md

# Or view in your editor/browser
```

The guide includes:
- 13 detailed test cases
- Step-by-step procedures
- Expected vs actual results
- Visual inspection checklists
- Performance metrics
- Edge case scenarios

---

### **Option 3: Automated Verification Only**

Just verify the code without manual testing:

```bash
# Run automated verification
./verify-docx-improvements.sh

# This checks:
# - All files exist
# - Code implementations present
# - Build successful
# - TypeScript compiles
# - Documentation complete
```

---

## 📋 **WHAT TO TEST**

### **🔴 CRITICAL Tests (MUST VERIFY)**

These are the most important - test these first:

1. **Save Persistence**
   - Edit a document
   - Save it
   - Close and reopen
   - **VERIFY**: Edits still there ✅

2. **File Validation**
   - Try to upload a 100MB file
   - **VERIFY**: Rejected with error ✅
   - Try to upload .txt renamed as .docx
   - **VERIFY**: Rejected as invalid ✅

3. **Backup Creation**
   - Save a document 3 times
   - Check `uploads/backups/` directory
   - **VERIFY**: 3 backup files created ✅

---

### **⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY Tests**

4. **Progress Indicator**
   - Open a large DOCX (>1MB)
   - **VERIFY**: Progress bar shows 0% → 100% ✅

5. **Retry Mechanism**
   - Disconnect internet
   - Try to open document
   - **VERIFY**: Error screen with "Try Again" button ✅

---

### **📊 MEDIUM PRIORITY Tests**

6. **Search** - Toggle search panel, find text
7. **Page Navigation** - Jump to different pages
8. **Track Changes** - Toggle track changes panel
9. **Comments** - Toggle comments panel
10. **Print** - Click print button

---

### **💡 LOW PRIORITY Tests**

11. **Auto-Save Feedback** - Watch toast notifications
12. **Error Handling** - Test network errors
13. **Mobile** - Test on mobile screen sizes

---

6. Backup created → uploads/backups/{id}-{timestamp}.docx
```

#### **Load Flow**:
```
1. Click on document → Loading screen appears
2. Progress bar → 0% "Initializing editor..."
3. Progress bar → 40% "Downloading document..."
4. Progress bar → 75% "Validating file..."
5. Progress bar → 100% "Almost ready..."
6. Editor opens → Document displays with all pages
```

#### **Browser Console** (No Errors):
```
✅ "SuperDoc ready with full editing mode:"

## 🐛 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Problem: "Save" button doesn't work**

**Check**:
1. Browser console for errors
2. Network tab - is API call made?
3. Is resumeId being passed to component?
4. Is file size < 50MB?

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Verify in browser console:
console.log('Resume ID:', resumeId);
console.log('File size:', fileSize);
```

---

### **Problem: Document won't load**

**Check**:
1. Does file exist in `uploads/resumes/`?
2. Is file path correct in database?
3. Is DOCX signature valid?
4. Check browser console for errors

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check file exists
ls -la uploads/resumes/{resumeId}.docx

# Try with a different file
```

---

### **Problem: Edits not persisting**

**This was the original bug - should be fixed!**

**Verify**:
1. Check network tab - is PUT request made?
2. Check server logs - did save succeed?
3. Check `uploads/resumes/` - is file updated (check timestamp)?

**If still fails**:
```bash
# Check server logs
npm run dev | grep "Updated DOCX"

# Should see: "✅ Updated DOCX file for resume: {id}"
```
