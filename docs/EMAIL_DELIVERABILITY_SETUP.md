## üîê Email Authentication (CRITICAL)

### 1. SPF (Sender Policy Framework)

SPF tells email servers which IP addresses are authorized to send emails from your domain.

**Add this TXT record to your domain's DNS:**

```
Type: TXT
Name: @ (or your domain name)
Value: v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:spf.protection.outlook.com ~all
```

**For different providers:**
- **Gmail/Google Workspace:** `v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all`
- **Outlook/Microsoft 365:** `v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com ~all`
- **SendGrid:** `v=spf1 include:sendgrid.net ~all`
- **Custom SMTP:** `v=spf1 ip4:YOUR_SERVER_IP ~all`

**Testing SPF:**
```bash
dig TXT yourdomain.com
# or
nslookup -type=TXT yourdomain.com
```

### 2. DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)

DKIM adds a digital signature to your emails to verify authenticity.

#### For Gmail/Google Workspace:

1. Go to **Google Admin Console** ‚Üí **Apps** ‚Üí **Google Workspace** ‚Üí **Gmail**
2. Navigate to **Authenticate email**
3. Click **Generate new record**
4. Copy the DNS record provided

**Add to your DNS:**
```
Type: TXT
Name: google._domainkey
Value: [the long key provided by Google]
```

#### For Outlook/Microsoft 365:

1. Go to **Microsoft 365 Admin Center** ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Domains**
2. Select your domain ‚Üí **DNS records**
3. Add the DKIM records provided

**Add to your DNS:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: selector1._domainkey
Value: selector1-<domain>._domainkey.<initial-domain>.onmicrosoft.com

Type: CNAME
Name: selector2._domainkey
Value: selector2-<domain>._domainkey.<initial-domain>.onmicrosoft.com
```

**Testing DKIM:**
- Send a test email to yourself
- Check email headers for `DKIM-Signature` field
- Use tools like https://dkimvalidator.com/

### 3. DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication)

DMARC tells email servers what to do if SPF or DKIM checks fail.

**Add this TXT record to your domain's DNS:**

```
Type: TXT
Name: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:postmaster@yourdomain.com; pct=100; adkim=s; aspf=s
```

**DMARC Policy Options:**
- `p=none` - Monitor only (recommended for testing)
- `p=quarantine` - Mark as spam if authentication fails
- `p=reject` - Reject emails that fail authentication (strictest)

**Recommended DMARC for production:**
```
v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com; ruf=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com; fo=1; pct=100; adkim=s; aspf=s
```

**Testing DMARC:**
```bash
dig TXT _dmarc.yourdomain.com
```
