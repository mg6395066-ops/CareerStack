# Next Step Comments Integration Instructions

## Overview
This document provides instructions for integrating the new Next Step Comments functionality into the CareerStack application.

## Files Created/Modified

### Database
- âœ… `migrations/0008_next_step_comments.sql` - Database migration for next step comments table
- âœ… `shared/schema.ts` - Updated with nextStepComments table, relations, and types

### Backend
- âœ… `server/routes/nextStepCommentsRoutes.ts` - New API routes for next step comments CRUD operations

### Frontend
- âœ… `client/src/components/marketing/next-step-comments.tsx` - React component for managing next step comments
- âœ… `client/src/components/marketing/requirements-section.tsx` - Updated to include NextStepComments component in view dialog

## Integration Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
# Run the migration to create the next_step_comments table
npm run db:migrate
```

### 2. Integrate API Routes
Add the following to your main server file (likely `server/index.ts` or `server/app.ts`):

```typescript
import nextStepCommentsRoutes from './routes/nextStepCommentsRoutes';

// Add this line with your other route registrations
app.use('/api/marketing', nextStepCommentsRoutes);
```

### 3. Update Marketing Routes (Alternative)
If you prefer to integrate directly into `marketingRoutes.ts`, copy the route handlers from `nextStepCommentsRoutes.ts` and add them to the existing marketing routes file.

## API Endpoints

The following new endpoints are available:

- `GET /api/marketing/requirements/:id/next-step-comments` - Get all comments for a requirement
- `POST /api/marketing/requirements/:id/next-step-comments` - Add a new comment
- `PATCH /api/marketing/next-step-comments/:id` - Update a comment (owner only)
- `DELETE /api/marketing/next-step-comments/:id` - Delete a comment (owner only)

## Features Implemented

### âœ… Completed Features
1. **Database Schema**: New `next_step_comments` table with proper relations
2. **API Endpoints**: Full CRUD operations for next step comments
3. **Authentication**: Only authenticated users can manage comments
4. **Authorization**: Users can only edit/delete their own comments
5. **UI Component**: Rich comment thread interface with:
   - Add new comments
   - Edit existing comments (owner only)
   - Delete comments (owner only)
   - Real-time updates
   - User attribution with timestamps
   - Responsive design

### ðŸ”„ Migration Strategy
- Legacy `next_step` field is preserved for backward compatibility
- Existing next step data is migrated to the new comments table
- Old next step field is shown as "Legacy Next Step" in the UI

1. **View Comments**: Navigate to Marketing â†’ Requirements â†’ Click "View" on any requirement
2. **Add Comment**: Click "Add Comment" button in the Next Step Comments section
