## Step 1: Run the Database Migration

Run this command to assign roles to existing users and set you as admin:

```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -f migrations/0006_assign_user_roles.sql
```

Expected output:
```
UPDATE X
UPDATE 1
CREATE INDEX
NOTICE:  Migration completed:
NOTICE:    - Users with "user" role: X
NOTICE:    - Users with "admin" role: 1
```

## Step 2: Restart Your Application

```bash
# If running in development:
npm run dev

# If running in production:
npm run build && npm start

# Or with PM2:
pm2 restart all
```

## Step 3: Test Your Admin Access

### 1. Log in with your admin account
   - Email: `12shivamtiwari219@gmail.com`
   - Use your existing password

### 2. Check for the Admin button
   - Look in the header navigation
   - You should see a purple "Admin" button next to Multi-Editor

### 3. Visit the Admin Dashboard
   - Click the "Admin" button OR
   - Navigate to: `http://localhost:5000/admin` (or your domain)

### 4. Verify Admin Features Work
   - âœ… See user statistics (total users, by role, recent)
   - âœ… See list of all users
   - âœ… Try searching for a user
   - âœ… Try changing a user's role
   - âœ… See role filters working

## Step 4: Test Role Protection

### Test as Admin (YOU):
1. âœ… Visit `/admin` - Should work
2. âœ… Visit `/marketing` - Should work
3. âœ… Visit `/email` - Should work
4. âœ… Visit `/dashboard` - Should work

### Test as Regular User:
1. Log out
2. Log in with another account (or create new one)
3. Try to visit `/admin` - Should redirect to `/unauthorized`
4. Try to visit `/marketing` - Should redirect to `/unauthorized`
5. Try to visit `/email` - Should redirect to `/unauthorized`
6. Visit `/dashboard` - Should work âœ…

## Step 5: Assign Roles to Your Team

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the Admin button"
**Problem:** Migration didn't run or email mismatch

**Solutions:**
1. Check your email in the database:
   ```bash
   psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT email, role FROM users WHERE email = '12shivamtiwari219@gmail.com';"
   ```

2. If role is not 'admin', run:
   ```bash
   psql $DATABASE_URL -c "UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = '12shivamtiwari219@gmail.com';"
   ```

3. Clear browser cache and log out/in again

### "Getting 403 errors on /api/admin"
**Problem:** Session doesn't have role information

**Solutions:**
1. Log out completely
2. Clear all cookies
3. Log back in
4. Role should now be in session

### "Migration fails"
**Problem:** Database connection or syntax error

**Solutions:**
1. Check DATABASE_URL is set:
   ```bash
   echo $DATABASE_URL
   ```

2. Test database connection:
   ```bash
   psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1;"
   ```

3. If connection works, run migration manually:
   ```sql
   -- Set default role
   UPDATE users SET role = 'user' WHERE role IS NULL OR role = '';
   
   -- Set your admin role
   UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = '12shivamtiwari219@gmail.com';
   
   -- Add index
   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_role ON users (role);
   ```

### "Unauthorized page shows for everything"
**Problem:** Role field not in TypeScript schema

**Solution:**
1. The code should be updated already
2. If still happening, restart TypeScript server:
   ```bash
   # Stop server
   # Delete node_modules/.cache
   rm -rf node_modules/.cache
   # Restart
   npm run dev
   ```

## ðŸ“Š Verify Everything is Working

Run this checklist:

### Backend Verification:
```bash
# Check if role column exists
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\d users" | grep role

# Check your admin role
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT email, role FROM users WHERE role = 'admin';"

# Check all user roles
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT role, COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY role;"
```

### Frontend Verification:
1. Log in as admin
2. Open browser DevTools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Type: `localStorage.getItem('user')`
5. Should see your user data with `"role":"admin"`

### API Verification:
Test admin endpoint:
```bash
# Should work (with valid session)
curl -H "Cookie: sid=YOUR_SESSION_ID" http://localhost:5000/api/admin/stats

# Should return 401/403 without proper role
curl http://localhost:5000/api/admin/stats
```
